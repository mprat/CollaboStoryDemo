================

Todo:
* Be able to search for a story by name
* Get users to add sentences to a story
* Add a story on the front page
* Be able to add a story in the admin interface without adding sentences. What's up with the text field anyway?
* Sentences don't have to be unique

* Should you make sure your admin site works first, so you can test your user site? I think yes!
* The best way to learn Django is to skim the tutorial, then try to build something
